        My name is August Ada King. I'm the Countess of Lovelace.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a mathematician and a writer. People know me from my work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical engine. I wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine.
        In other words, I am the world's first programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
        My mother, Anne Isabella Byron, was a great help to me as she helped me by promoting my interest in mathematics and logic, but I also never forgot about my dad, who moved to Greece when I was just an infant to help out in the civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my life, mathematics have been my primary interest. I always question even basic assumptions by integrating poetry, another great love of mine, and science.
        <br/>
        I also have a keen interest in scientific developments and trends of my era like phrenology and mesmerism.

        <blockquote>&ldquo;
                Charles Babbage wrote the following poem about me:
                <br/>
                <span="poem">
                        Forget this world and all its troubles and if<br/>
                        possible its multitudinous Charlatans-every thing<br/>
                        in short but the Enchantress of Numbers.
                </span>
